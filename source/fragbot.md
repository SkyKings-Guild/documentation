# Frag Bot

A Frag Bot is a Minecraft bot that can be used to join a Skyblock dungeon with only one player.

To use it, simply party it in-game and join a dungeon. 
You will be able to join the dungeon, and the bot will automatically leave so it can be used by another player.

For our frag bot usernames, please visit the Frag Bot channel in our 
[Discord server](https://skykings.net/discord).
