# Developer Documentation

Our bridge bots have two main ways that developers can extend them without modifying the source:

- The Redis server, described [here](/bridge/redis)
- Extensions, shortly described [here](/bridge/extensions)

This section goes more in-depth on extensions, and how to make them.
