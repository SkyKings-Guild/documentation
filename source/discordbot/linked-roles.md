# Linked Roles

Linked roles is a Discord feature that allows you to add requirements to roles, 
and make those roles self-assignable by server members.

## Server Members

Linked Roles can be accessed by clicking the server name above the channel list, and selecting "Linked Roles".

To get a linked role, select the role. You may be taken to an external site and asked to allow SkyKings to 
"Update your connection and metadata for this application" and "Access your username, avatar, and banner".
This will not grant SkyKings access to your account.

Once done, you will be able to assign yourself roles. If you assign yourself a role, 
some stats about your Skyblock profile will also be available on your Discord profile.

You can update your stats by running `/verify sync`.


## Server Managers

Linked Roles can be created in your server's "Roles" tab, under Server Settings. 
After selecting a role to make a linked role, you can convert it into a Linked Role and add requirements to it 
by selecting the "Links" tab in the role.

```{note}
Creating linked roles *may* only be available on the Desktop or Web version of Discord.
